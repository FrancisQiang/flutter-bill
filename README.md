# Flutter Bill 

> Flutter SDK (Channel stable, v1.7.8+hotfix.4, on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.720], locale zh-CN)

## Introduction

  :heart_eyes::heart_eyes::heart_eyes: This project is an simple app developed by Flutter for users and developers to learn Flutter 。

  Because the logical structure of this project is relatively simple, but at the same time it covers a lot of knowledge points developed by Flutter, such as the use of persistence layer Sp, SQLite, theme configuration, simple animation effect, the encapsulation of Dio, and the use of some plug-ins to wait, this project is more suitable for novice beginners to learn. 

  In the message wall content is the author built back-end server (because I actually learn back-end), you have any feedback can be directly here message. if you want to contact the author you can add the following contact details. 

  :blush:Since the authors themselves are not mobile, front-end developers, there are many details that may not be noticed, I hope you understand. Learning Flutter is just a hobby, because the next stage needs to prepare for next year's autumn interview, so later updates will be slower. 

  :thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup:Thank for[一日清单](https://github.com/asjqkkkk/flutter-todos)(A beautiful Flutter todo app)author，Providing inspiration and learning projects。
